# Alzheimer Classification Using CNN (ResNet50)

This project focuses on image classification for Alzheimer’s disease detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on ResNet50. After training the model, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as LIME and Grad-CAM, are applied to explain and interpret the model's predictions.


## Objectives

- Training the CNN Model (ResNet50): Constructing and training a high-performance model for image classification to distinguish between stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
- Interpretative Analysis with XAI: Using LIME and Grad-CAM techniques to visualize and understand the model’s regions of interest, facilitating better interpretation of the classification results.

## Architecture of ResNet50
